Project 2
Aaron Yih


a.) The most notable obstacle I overcame was setting the precision to two decimal places. Several of the solutions online misled me with instructions to use “fixed.” After several failed attempts, I found a solution that seemed to work: #include <iomanip> and “<<setprecision(2)<< bill << ‘\n’.

Another notable challenge I had was unrelated to the program but was equally frustrating. Signing up for an account required that I wait a day. After that, I had a lot of trouble using Remote Desktop Connection. It took me several hours to finally connect to the SEASNET server. 

b.) 	i.)negative meter readings(-100, 10, Person Name, 8)
	ii.)final meter reading greater than initial meter reading(450, 30, Person Name, 9)
	iii.)meter did not change(100, 100, Person Name, 5)
	iv.)name is empty(100, 300, “”, 7)
	v.)month is not valid(23, 52, Person Name, 45)
	vi.)all data valid (100, 545, Person Name, 3)
	vii.) wrong data type for name input(190, 300, 54, 6)
	
	reasons:
	i.) Test a possible but invalid user input
	ii.) Test a possible but invalid user input
	iii.) Test a possible and valid user input that has potential to cause an issue
	iv.) Test a possible but invalid user input
	v.) Test a possible but invalid user input
	vi.) Test the program for valid values 
	vii.) Test a possible but invalid user input
